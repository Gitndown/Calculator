This is my calculator project.

It follows the MVP and contains the following functions:

- Addition. Output display should add values together

* Subtraction. Output should minus values and also be able to display and calculate negative numbers.

รท Division. Output should be able to divide values.

x Multiplication. Output should be able to multiply values entered from thee input.

CE Clear All. When clicked all output display should return back to 0.

This is not using the eval function. We are using divs to create a grid for the buttons. Buttons are made up of <input> sections which are manipulated with the 'onclick' event attribute that contains our JS functions.

I have used different resources to achieve the result below and included detailed notes in the JS file.

Css is basic but the color pallette follows the reference image used.

This calculator gone through multiple evolutions and the code has been changed many times but this was the most sound solution.
